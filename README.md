# MQP: AI-Powered 3D Facial Generation for Robotic Interfaces
__Project Overview__  
This project explores the generation of realistic 2D human facial images using StyleGAN3 and maps these images onto a 3D surface using PyTorch3D. The primary goal is to assess and enhance the realism of the generated images when displayed on a flexible LCD screen wrapped around a sphere shaped like a human head. Fr√©chet Inception Distance (FID) will be used to evaluate the realism of the images throughout the process.

__Project Objectives__    
 - Generate high-quality 2D facial images using StyleGAN3.  
 - Map these generated images onto a 3D spherical surface that mimics the shape of a human head using PyTorch3D.  
 - Evaluate the realism of the 3D representation using FID.  
 - Display the final 3D face on a flexible LCD screen, focusing on realism and adaptability to 3D surfaces.

__Technologies Used__    
 - StyleGAN3: For generating high-resolution, realistic 2D facial images.  
 - FID: To measure the quality and realism of the generated images.  
 - PyTorch3D: For mapping 2D images onto a 3D surface and rendering the final display.  
 - Flexible LCD screen: To display the generated 3D face on robotic head.
 - NVIDIA RTX A5000: NVIDIA GPU to improve processing speeds
